<h2>     </h2>
<p>Mango Poppy used to be a human. She is of mixed origin, born of Western Pennsylvania, Northern Germany and Northern India. She is a mango and she is a poppy. She is no longer a human, but she has a soul. She has bright crimson leaves most of the time (she's very red), but sometimes her color is an orange-yellow. She is made up of a very juicy, sweet fruit, very edible. Sometimes considered the most delectable fruit. She has a very hard, impenetrable, inedible center, a large pit at her core. Her center is black. She sometimes grows in fields but in New England she is usually alone. No other Mango Poppies here, but perhaps they aren't indigenous anywhere. Perhaps 3 continents of genes weren't meant to be combined, Mango Poppy is just a mutation. </p>
<p> Mango Poppy used to be a human but then she found human emotions and human search for a purpose a burden. Now she is just a pretty flower, delicious to eat and harmfully addictive. Many men humans like Mango Poppy. A few even saw her as a pretty, exotic fruit before she knew she was one. They wanted to have her. The men couldn't hear her when she tried to speak, they took her beautiful fruit by night as she whispered "no," letting her wake up in the daylight to pain. Pain in places her pit would eventually grow. Now Mango Poppy is free. She is just a pretty flower and a sweet fruit. She doesn't hold memories or emotions. Her black pit doesn't open anymore. She is still often consumed, but she doesn't care. Eventually her consumers learn of her black pit and leave her. Mango Poppy wants to experience love, but she is just an addictive drug, an exotic tease, a gathering of seductive red petals. <a href="http://mangopoppy.github.io/site/after.html">Enter Mango Poppy</a></p>
