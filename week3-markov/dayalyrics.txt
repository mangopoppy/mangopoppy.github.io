Dare

Dare me to reach a little higher
You can dare me to step over the edge
I dare you to dare me to go play with fire
I'm gonna do everything that you never did
I'll leave my footprints on the water
Bet on the dark horse until I'm a millionaire
And you can all sit back and say that I'm a loser
But I don't worry 'cause the truth is in the dare

So go on dare me to lose dare me to move
Dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?

I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare I dare I dare I dare you to

There was a time I was afraid of
The dark and monsters livin' underneath my bed
And then I said Enough is enough simply because
The only monsters were the voices in my head

So go on dare me to lose dare me to move
Dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?

I dare you to

Legendary

Oh I don't want to try it
Cause I'm scared that I'm gonna like it
And I can look but I'm not going to buy it
Cause my heart heart is on a diet

But you give off something so cool you do you do
So I guess I'm bending my rules for you for you

Let's pretend that it's a holiday
Boy you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss and gon' blow away
Like a valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today so.
Why not make it legendary?

No you can't get a remix
To testify about all of the kisses
When it's gone you know you going to miss this
At least you'll check check me off your wish list

Yeah I give off something so cool I do I do
And I'll give a little to you to you to you

Let's pretend that it's a holiday
Boy you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss and gon' blow away

Why not make it legendary?

Hurry up before you're out of time so come on boy hurry up
Better to it before I change my mind before I don't give a what
Hurry up before you're out of time so come on boy hurry up
Better to it before I change my mind before I don't give a what

Why not make it legendary?

Why you? Why you gotta be so uncool?
I told you I didn't want us to continue

But it's like it went in your ear
And came out on the other side
I guess you didn't wanna hear
But now it's time for you to get it right

In case you missed it or just don't get it

In case you missed it you need to let it go
And find baby find something better to do
Then calling all night 'cause I won't call back
No I don't like you know I don't like that
In case you missed it let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you over you

Easy I tried to make it easy
To leave me but I guess you don't believe me

Running telling all your friends
We're going on another date
Something's missing in your head
And now it's time for you to get it straight

In case you missed it or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you over you
In case you missed it you need to let it go
And find baby find something better to do
Then calling all night 'cause I won't call back

Thirsty

You got that lemonade
But baby I ain't buying
Need something hotter to melt the ice
Get you some Gatorade because your mouth is drying
From drooling over me day and night

Can't you hold your horses
I know you want the cake but
Don't skip all the courses

Boy you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me-eh-eh
Won't get to first base by baking' me-eh-eh da da da da da da
You wanna play the game?
Give me a little space and maybe you'll get a taste

Wanna invite me over

Can't you hold your horses
I know you want the cake but
Don't skip all the courses

Boy you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me-eh-eh

Love Of My Life

You got the touch you got the magic
Making me blush you keep me coming back for more
Gave you too much I'll let you have it
It's gonna suck this is a thing I can't ignore

You won't mistake me
But you never take me all the way
All the way no no no
And now I'd hate to break your heart
But I don't wanna waste
Anymore time on you

I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life
I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life

Baby don't beg or buy me flowers
You cannot stay cause it would only make it worse
You want a chick that's on your lips for hours
So I walk away but I don't wanna see you hurt

You understood me
But you never took me all the way
All the way no no no
And now I'd hate to break your heart
But I don't wanna waste
Anymore time on you

I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life
I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life

I really like you but you're not that right for me
I rather wait all my life to find the one
I really like you but it's just not meant to be
Oh I'm so sorry I am oh yeah

I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life
I could like you 'til the day that I die
But I'm looking for the love of my life

Hide Away

Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls
Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother Hey!
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie cause under cover
He's gonna save my life like superman
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away?

Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Hey!

Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away?
Hey!

Hide away hide away
Hide away hide away

Looking high and low someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away hide away?
Hey!

Cool

I still feel your kisses in the morning
Even though you're not around
Maybe I should take it as a warning
That my secret's finally... out

And you know that I know that you know just how I feel
And I know that you know that I know this thing's for real
We lay low but it never feels boring
Cause my heart is racing for you

Let's just sit back and cruise cruise cruise
That's all I wanna do do do
I know you want it too too too
It's perfect 'cause there's never any pressure baby
You know how to keep it cool

Funny how you get me so excited
When we're doin' nothing at all
Simple as a movie at the drive-in
Or a good long distance... call

But you know that I know that you know just how I feel
And I know that you know that I know this thing's for real
Let's speed off right into the horizon
Or just close our eyes and fall

Let's just sit back and cruise cruise cruise
That's all I wanna do do do
I know you want it too too too
It's perfect 'cause there's never any pressure baby
You know how to keep it cool

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Me and you
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Me and you

Let's just sit back and cruise cruise cruise
That's all I wanna do do do
I know you want it too too too
It's perfect 'cause there's never any pressure baby
You know how to keep it cool

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Me and you
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Keep it cool
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Me and you

Sit Still Look Pretty

Could dress up
To get love
But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world

Could wake up
In make up
And play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things
Like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo

That Snow White
She did right
In her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for

The only thing a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity
And I might love me some vanilla but I'm not that sugar sweet
Call me HBIC

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty

[2x]
Sure I'm a pretty girl
Up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still
I'm a pretty girl
Up in a pretty world
But no I won't sit still look pretty

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No I don't wanna sit still look pretty

Sit still look pretty

Talk

I'm not that plain and simple I'm in another lane
I'm like a Shirley Temple the cherry on the cake
Just a throwback kid from the nineties
I start my ABCs with the YZ
I paint with different colors and never in the lines
There isn't any other I am the prototype
Tick tock waste time with your rumors
But I'm so ice cold good humor

They say I'm outta my mind
Standing on the outside
It's cooler it's fresher
I like it here

They all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em something a little something ah a little
Something to talk about
Give 'em something a little something ah a little
Something to talk about

I don't believe in Yeezus I like 'em Kanye West
I'm rocking dirty sneakers with my designer dress
Would do a grade A steak with my pomme frite
I wake you up Starbucks sleep on me

They say I'm outta my mind
Standing on the outside
It's cooler it's fresher
I like it here

They all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em something a little something ah a little
Something to talk about
Give 'em something a little something ah a little
Something to talk about

No you don't know what
What you talking 'bout
No you don't know me
So just shut your mouth
No you don't know what
What you talking 'bout
No you don't know me
So just shut your...

They all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em something a little something ah a little
Something to talk about
Give 'em something a little something ah a little
Something to talk about

U12

Got sixteen candles make a wish and blow them out
Hoping for those three words you never say out loud
I know you play cool but I know you think about it
So make my wish come true and do something about it

All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love but I hope you want to too
Too-o-o too-o-o too-o-o

I don't know why they say young hearts are such a mystery
Feels like this thing we've got is part of ancient history
The way you look at me you kiss me is so classic
So let the haters do their thing 'til they get past it

All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love but I hope you want to too

Three four five six
Boy you're my lucky seven
And I'm your ten you're taking me to heaven
Three four five six
Boy you're my lucky seven
And I'm your ten you're taking me to heaven

All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love but I hope you want to too

Too-o-o too-o-o too-o-o

Words

Sorry boy even I'm that loud
Doesn't mean I'm out but a word could ruin it
Sorry boy gotta slow it down
Better shut your mouth do the talking with your lips

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim but I'm not jumping in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching those three little words feel too easy to say
But but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way oh way oh way oh
In the way oh way oh way oh
In the way in the way oh way oh way oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way
The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way

Like you lots I just had a thought
We could make it fun doesn't have to have a name
Everyone puts the pressure on
But we're not everyone so we don't have to do the same

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim but I'm not jumping in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching those three little words feel too easy to say
But but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way oh way oh way oh
In the way oh way oh way oh
In the way in the way oh way oh way oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way
The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way

Don't want a good heart to break Oh no
When we're touching those three little words feel too easy to say
But but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way oh way oh way oh In the way
In the way oh way oh way oh Only get in the way
In the way in the way oh way oh way oh Only get in the way
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way
The words only get in the way Get in the way
The words only get in the way

Back To Me

You only call me your baby when she wasn't there
Now you go calling me crazy because I don't care

We'll never turn back time now lovin' you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind when all I want to do do is stop

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'll never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
When I don't let you do me like that
Can't keep pulling you back to me me me me me
Can't keep pulling you back to me me me me me

I'll never trust you after the things that I saw
Who wants an ever after if it ain't forever at all

We'll never turn back time now lovin' you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind when all I want to do do is stop

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'll never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
When I don't let you do me like that

Can't keep pulling you back to me me me me me

You'll never be the one 'cause it's not how it's supposed to be
Won't pull you back pull you back pull you back to me

It's not enough so you're gonna have to break free

You'll never be the one 'cause it's not how it's supposed to be
Won't pull you back pull you back pull you back to me
I don't want your love baby we were never meant to be

Got The Feeling

Stuck between the wrong and the right thing
Can't make up my mind it's got a mind of its own
Felt a spark but there was no lightning
Could've walked away but still I'm coming back for more

Oh I'm loving your butterfly kisses
But it's like something is missing
Gonna save quitting your for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No it's not for life but it's alright right now
Right now I got the feeling right now
It's alright right now

Stuck between the green and the red light
Can't make up my mind should I stop or should I go?
Find it hard to leave after midnight
Using the excuse that it's too late to walk me home

Oh I'm loving your summertime kisses
But it's like something is missing
Gonna save quitting your for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No it's not for life but it's alright right now
Right now I got the feeling it's alright right now
It's alright right now

I got the feeling got the feeling
I got the feeling got the feeling
I got the feeling got the feeling whoa oh
Oh I'm loving your butterfly kisses
But it's like something is missing
Gonna save quitting your for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No it's not for life but it's alright right now
Right now I got the feeling right now
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No it's not for life but it's alright right now

We Are

Stay out late night running red lights
That's the air we like to breathe
Breaking your ties crossing your lines
Leaping over boundaries
There's never been a mold that you could fit us in
Doing what we're born to do is not a sin

'Cause we are gonna be we are gonna be who we are
We don't really care we don't really care what you want
Never put a we never put a we in the box
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm telling you we won't stop

Because we are we are we are we are
We are the young we are the world
You know who we are
We are we are we are we are
We are the young we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless but we're gonna do just what we do 'cause we are we are we are we are
We are the young we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are

Make our own rules sticking like fools
Ready to call the police
We can skip school 'cause we're too cool
To be told we can't be free
You can go ahead and try to knock us out
Ain't no keeping us from doing what we love
'Cause we love it too much

We are gonna be we are gonna be who we are
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm telling you we won't stop won't stop

Because we are we are we are we are
We are the young we are the world
You know who we are
We are we are we are we are
We are the young we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless but we're gonna do just what we do 'cause we are we are we are we are
We are the young we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are

We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay and
We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay and

We might be reckless but we're gonna do just what we do 'cause we are we are we are we are
We are the young we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are
We are you know who we are
