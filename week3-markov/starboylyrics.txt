Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love we just pray for cars

House so empty need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

Bathroom stalls for the powder nose she loves
High heel shoes with the open toes she loves

So obsessed with the camera lights she loves
You love her but you can't deny she loves
The truth the truth

She chase hearts with the Hennessy she loves
You love her but you'll never be she loves
Enough enough

reminder

Recommend play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly we gone let her go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like goddamn bitch I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn bitch I am not a bleach boy
Whip game make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate

Faded off a double cup I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies roll until my nose bleed
I'mma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day tryna lose weight
That good sex we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause


You know me you know me
You know man you know me
Every time we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again

stargirl interlude

I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratching counter tops I was screaming
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop you were hitting it
And I shouldn't cry but I love it starboy
And I shouldn't cry but I love it I love it starboy
And I shouldn't cry but I love it starboy
And I shouldn't cry but I love it starboy


I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl

sidewalks


Uh uh uh uh-uh uh yeah like


I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks


Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

Say say say
I come from murder one brung late night melee
Say say say
We hung all summer sprung mattress with bae bae
Say say say
Trippin' off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Say say say
Flippin' blue lightning tightening strapped with AK
Say say say
OG one told me one show me one eight ways
How to segue
Pussy power profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence
Or life innocent
Or life intimate with fame
Light limo tint
With light women dark women in it
Awe Kenny good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star boy
Astronomer anonymous
I line 'em up we grind 'em up there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up I tallied up all the parts boy
Twenty legs arms head head
Head head and more head head
Oh God bless the dead yah
I'm livin' life high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock I wanna rock I wanna cop more land
I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything I'm a hustler came from


Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs

They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home she got it


She lick it up just like a candy

ordinary life

Heaven in her mouth got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine I'ma die when I cum
She just givin' head she don't know what I done
Like I'm James Dean I'ma die when I'm young
Die when I'm young die when I'm young

Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
And she said that she'll pray for me
I said "It's too late for me"
'Cause I think it's safe to say...


This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life

Valhalla is where all the righteous are led
Mulholland's where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
Cross on my neck cross on my neck
Over 45 I'ma drift on a bend
Do a buck 20 I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end but I feel nothin'

She said that she'll pray for me
I said "It's too late for me"
'Cause I think it's safe to say...


This ain't ordinary life
